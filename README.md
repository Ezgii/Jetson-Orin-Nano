In this project, a NEMA17 stepper motor is driven using a motor driver (A4988) connected to a Jetson Orin Nano. The Jetson Orin Nano's PWM output regulates the motor's steps, while its GPIO output manages the motor's spinning direction. An LSM303 sensor is used to compute the angular displacement of the motor. The Jetson Orin Nano hosts a web server accessible via a web browser. Users can engage with a custom ChatGPT on this webpage, seeking technical guidance. ChatGPT assists the user on how to spin the motor at a desired angle, in the desired direction. As a feedback, the readings from the sensor is shown to the user.
